The World Health Organization found that foodborne disease causes a global health burden similar to that of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or malaria. Nearly all of this burden falls on poor countries (98 percent) and most is due to consumption of meat, milk, eggs, fish, fruit and vegetables. These are the very foods with greatest potential to increase dietary diversity and fight under- and over-nutrition. As we consider agricultural development and ways to improve the nutritional status of people around the world, we must remember that it’s not enough to make sure people have access to nutritious food: the food must also be safe. The CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) has made food safety one of its five research flagships. Through this program, we focus on: Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) has been developing evidence syntheses for and with major players such as BMGF, DFID, USAID, FAO and World Bank. In 2017, A4NH cohosted a workshop on targeting food safety investments in low and middle-income countries. A central theme emerging from that workshop echoes throughout our work: collaboration and knowledge-sharing will be key in addressing food safety challenges, and this collaboration must include the formal and informal markets, policymakers, researchers, and public and private sectors. Working together, we can solve problems and improve both the nutrition and health of people throughout the world.
