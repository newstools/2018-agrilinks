Today, the world celebrates International Women’s Day, an occasion to salute the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women, while also acknowledging the progress that needs to be made toward gender equality in an actionable way. Each year, International Women’s Day takes on a new focus, and the 2018 theme is Press for Progress (#pressforprogress), a call to action for people, institutions and communities to commit to being purveyors of women’s empowerment and inclusiveness. The Agrilinks community is deeply involved in women’s empowerment work as well as promoting gender equality through global agricultural sectors. In support of International Women’s Day, here are some posts and resources from the Agrilinks archives that connect this year’s theme with women in agriculture. “Women contribute significantly to agriculture and food security around the globe, and gender equality and women’s empowerment are critical to ensuring sustainable development. Yet women continue to face unequal access to training, resources, and opportunities to adopt new agricultural technologies, grow their businesses, and spend their earned income to improve the well-being of themselves and their families.” — USAID's Bureau for Food Security’s Cultivating Women’s Empowerment: Stories from Feed the Future 2011-2015, a 2016 report. International Women’s Day is a kickoff to a year of promoting gender equality and advancing women’s progress in various sectors. How will you #pressforprogress to amplify the women in your community?
