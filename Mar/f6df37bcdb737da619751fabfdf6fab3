Expected publication date: March 30, 2018 This updated Feed the Future Indicator Handbook presents the set of performance management indicators for phase two of the USG’s Feed the Future initiative, guided by the Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS). The indicators are designed to measure progress against each result in the Feed the Future results framework.

This product is the result of a nearly year-long process of ongoing interagency cooperation, two public comment periods (1, 2), and collaboration with other technical experts within USAID to pull together a list of standard indicators best suited for measuring the results of our food security work and to flesh out clear definitions for each. On October 1, 2017, the final list of indicators was cleared and published as part of the GFSS Implementation Report, and since then, a working group has been working to fully define these indicators and draft an introduction that articulates general principles for the implementation of these indicators.  Representatives from across USAID and other U.S. Government agencies have been involved in the process. Who should use this handbook? Anyone involved in managing or monitoring a Feed the Future activity. USAID Operating Units and implementing partners (IPs), as well as interagency partners, should use the Feed the Future standard indicators, appropriate custom indicators, and performance narratives to manage, adapt and report on performance of individual implementing mechanisms (IMs) and to monitor progress towards applicable outputs, outcomes, and impacts.
