Resilience measurementÂ and the resilience connection to livelihood diversification and sustainable poverty escapes have been identified as priority learning areas by participants who have completed the 2015 training, "An Introduction to Resilience at USAID and Beyond." As a result, a new online training series focusing on resilience is now available on the Agrilinks Tools and Training page. Each one-hour interactive module is self-paced and contains messages from thought leaders, detailed content on thematic issues, a review of frontier topics and considerations for development programming. The series will improve participant understanding of resilience, increase knowledge of the association and interaction of resilience with other development topics and priorities, and explore the application of these concepts in related programming.
