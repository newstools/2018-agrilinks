Feed the Future Bangladesh Aquaculture and Nutrition Activity has launched a second call for proposals. The five-year WorldFish-led, USAID-funded project is looking for innovative business ideas/concepts from private sector companies and organizations that have the potential to transform aquaculture in Bangladesh, particularly for women, youth and small-scale farmers. This is a two-stage process where interested private sector companies and organizations must firstly provide basic details about themselves and their business ideas/concepts in the form of an outline business application. The business ideas/concepts will be evaluated, and successful proposals will then be developed into detailed business proposals and funding requests by the private sector companies and organizations working together with staff from the Activity. Interested private sector companies and organizations should download the following key documents and submit the completed application form to wfbanaproject@cgiar.org (link sends e-mail). The deadline for application submission is December 31, 2018 at 5pm (Bangladesh time).
