Solicitation Number: 7200AA18R00044Deadline for Questions: May 21, 2018Deadline to Submit Expressions of Interest: June 1, 2018 USAID is pleased to announce the release of the Nutrition Innovations in Complex Environments Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).This BAA reflects a collaborative effort across USAID's Bureau for Food Security (BFS), the Bureau for Global Health (GH), and the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance's (DCHA) Office of Food For Peace (FFP), in coordination with the Eleanor Crook Foundation (ECF) and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID). As set out at the 2017 Milan Global Nutrition Summit, USAID, DFID, and ECF, share a common interest in supporting the fight to end chronic and acute malnutrition. Addressing malnutrition will require concerted, coordinated efforts to scale up what works, and to find effective, innovative, and scalable solutions to the most intractable drivers of poor nutrition. This BAA is designed to create an opportunity for co-design and collaboration with USAID to conduct cutting-edge R&D to find new and innovative ways of combating malnutrition. Innovation is particularly needed in chronically nutritionally and food-insecure contexts -- in other words, complex environments where there are persistent or recurrent crises, such as drought, conflict or instability. In these environments poor nutrition is likely holding back efforts to build resilience. Improved nutrition can both be a maker and marker of effective inclusive development. All questions and Expressions of Interest (EOI) should be submitted to BAANutrition@usaid.gov (link sends e-mail). Questions should be submitted by May 21, 2018 and EOIs should be submitted by June 1, 2018. The BAA can be found at the following two links: FedBizOpps Link: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=0bb68dee4f33d38921b4cdd198dad95d&tab=core&_cview=1 Grants.gov Link: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=7200AA18R00044
