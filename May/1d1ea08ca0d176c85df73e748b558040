The Resilience Measurement Practical Guidance Note Series synthesizes existing technical documents into pragmatic guidance to assist practitioners in integrating core aspects of resilience measurement into their program assessments, design, monitoring, evaluation, and learning. In five parts, the series introduces key concepts and guides practitioners through the process of resilience measurement, from assessment to analysis. Unlike many other program impacts (nutrition levels, poverty,e etc.), resilience is not an end in itself but rather an ability that shapes how and why outcomes change over time. This makes resilience measurement different from measurement of other program concepts, thus the need for this guidance. There are five guidance notes along with a summary brief in this series: The Resilience Measurement Practical Guidance Note Series was prepared by Mercy Corps in collaboration with the USAID Center for Resilience, TANGO International, and Save the Children under the Resilience Evaluation, Analysis and Learning (REAL) Award.
