Over the years, Développement international Desjardins (DID) has carried out dozens of projects related to rural finance, with numerous partners and in highly diversified environments. Across these interventions, we made some recurring observations: Based on this experience, we just issued a roadmap designed to guide our action as well as that of our partners and funding agencies in order to increase agricultural yields, associated revenues, and the level of agricultural and financial knowledge among the actors in the system. This roadmap outlines the importance of keeping a global view on the agricultural system, and of strengthening every actor in this system. This is how we believe we can have a true and sustainable impact on rural development and food security.

Our roadmap concludes on a few lessons learned, including the following: By emphasizing the sequence of our interventions, DID’s roadmap complements the position paper issued by DID in 2010 in which we outlined our vision and convictions regarding the best practices related to agricultural finance. Both documents use a sector approach aimed at strengthening the overall agricultural finance system.
