Robust, resilient market systems rely on efficient, rules-based interactions. A well-functioning, properly enforced system of sound rules creates an enabling environment for the business of agriculture, reducing the risks and lowering the cost of transacting vertically and horizontally within value chains. Both the lower risk and higher profits associated with a good, well-enforced legal system can lead to poverty reduction, food security, economic growth, employment, and systemic resilience. The enabling environment, which includes both formal rules (i.e., policies, laws, regulations, and standards) and informal rules (i.e., societal norms and traditions), directly impacts the performance of all segments in a market system. This means fewer efficiency losses throughout a value chain and more money available to invest in higher returns. In April, a group of enabling environment experts convened at the Market Systems Symposium in Cape Town, South Africa to discuss why it is so difficult to encourage donor investments in this space. Discussions led to a set of five principles to better integrate enabling environment interventions into programming, synthesized as follows: For an in-depth look at the role of the enabling environment in agricultural market systems, tools and best practices for enabling environment reforms, see the Enabling Environment in Market Systems Technical Note.
