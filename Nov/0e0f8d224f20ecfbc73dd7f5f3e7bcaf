The USAID-funded YouthLead.org platform is a new collaboration marketplace where young changemakers aged 15-35 can forge connections with a growing community of peers and partners looking to benefit from each other's experience — and eager to advance their work and scale their innovations.
YouthLead allows members to track funding opportunities that empower their change-making efforts, including grants, scholarships, conference travel support and tips for crowdfunding. They can even connect to peer mentors or other "allies" who offer professional mentoring to young change makers. The platform also features thematic discussion groups and webinars, with access to resources such as how-to manuals, case studies, research reports and presentations. The platform, managed by YouthPower Learning and Making Cents International, is supported through a collaborative effort by the LAC, Africa and E&E regions, as well as the DCHA, Global Health and BFS Bureaus. Why YouthLead? YouthLead sprang from the initial discussions of a group of 100 young changemakers from around the globe — including Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), Young Leaders of the Americas (YLAI), Atlas Corps Fellows, Teach for All, etc. — who have served as a Youth Advisory Group from the beginning of this activity. Their expectations shaped the features of YouthLead, with their key objectives to connect with changemakers globally, learn from each other and find peer-to-peer support and easy access to tools, experts and funding.
