The Green Revolution was successful because it enabled solitary subsistence farmers, often struggling to get enough food on the table, to become a part of integrated, commercial farm and food systems that raised incomes, increased food security and improved nutrition. As we strive to promote a similar and more sustainable transformation across Africa, we need to keep in mind that today’s transformations are different for several reasons: What will drive today’s agricultural transformation: How do we support a successful transformation? The answer lies, partly, in the eye of the beholder. Where does this leave us? First, it leaves us with a better conception of the complexity of food security and development, issues that engage multiple stakeholders within countries as well as externally. Second, it begs for a process to increase, coordinate and align stakeholder investments, actions and policies in agriculture and food systems. And this process is emerging — stay tuned for more on the process of mutual accountability coming up next week!!
