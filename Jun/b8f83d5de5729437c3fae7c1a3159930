Data-driven policy reform relies on sound analysis. Sound analysis rests on transparent result tracking over time. To provide the data and analysis necessary for USAID Missions and partners to develop effective country strategies, the Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Food Security (FTF-EEFS) project has produced policy data snapshots of 20 Feed the Future countries (both current and former). Using the World Bank’s Enabling the Business of Agriculture Index — a tool that measures the ease of doing agribusiness — FTF-EEFS offers analysis of each country’s performance against a range of key benchmarks, such as machinery, water, transport, finance, seed, fertilizer, and markets. Click on any country below to view its policy data snapshot: Through analyzing and ranking performance in these sectors, each policy data snapshot depicts a country’s unique enabling environment, identifying notable strengths as well as weak points in its agribusiness ecosystem. It also highlights opportunities to strengthen performance within specific areas covered by the index. For example, in Bangladesh, the lack of price regulations or other licensing requirements for traders makes export efficient and affordable. However, the country's low agricultural trade scores in the index could be improved by introducing a phytosanitary certificate requirement with electronic processing. Combined with complementary analysis of on-the-ground nuances within sub-sectors, this data can give Missions important insights into their host country’s unique enabling environment and inform policy reform prioritization.
