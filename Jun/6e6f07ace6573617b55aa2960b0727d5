USAID seeks comments on the draft program description for its new Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Research, Capacity and Policy Influence. Please view this posting on grants.gov for complete information and instructions. USAID is not requesting applications at this time - only comments. Comments must be submitted via e-mail to kmiskowski@usaid.gov (link sends e-mail) by June 19, 2018 at 4:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time. The purpose of this award is to advance food security policy through high quality, relevant research from credible and sound country and regional policy research institutions. The Innovation Lab will do this by strengthening the capacities of select country and regional research institutions and implement a global research agenda. USAID seeks comments from institutions or networks that have interest or capacity in food security-related policy research, including policy-relevant research in topics related to agriculture, nutrition, and risk and resilience. The prime awardee will be a US university, and USAID welcomes and seek comments from the US university community. In addition, we seek comments from African, Asian, and Latin American regional or national food security policy-related think tanks, policy analysis units, university departments, or others that have insight on how best to expand the policy research capacity and influence of such local and regional policy research units. We want to make sure that what USAID is asking for in this solicitation matches up with both the capacities of the US university community as well as the needs and realities on the ground of regional and national policy research institutions.
