“Good governance is perhaps the single most important factor in eradicating poverty and promoting development.” - former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan  WELCOME to food security policy month on Agrilinks! WHY we care: Public policy guides the development and use of resources. Effective policy formulation and implementation is a hallmark of self-reliance. Properly undertaken, it can incentivize private sector investment; civic agency and accountability; and encourage and accelerate good development outcomes. As development practitioners, we ignore or underinvest public policy at our own peril. WHAT we are doing: Feed the Future has acknowledged the critical importance of policy to our success from inception by prioritizing country ownership. Our experience and program evaluation have only reinforced this over time. Our investments in policy research and programs are helping us better understand how Feed the Future can contribute to good policy, and this month we have an opportunity to highlight lessons learned and best practices that are helping us to support better approaches to policy. This month, we want to help you: Meet some of our outstanding partners while you are waiting… Looking forward to the month ahead!
