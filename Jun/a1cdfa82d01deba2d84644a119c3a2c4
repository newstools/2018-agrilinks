This policy data snapshot provides data most relevant to USAID/Guatemala's Feed the Future work. According to the World Bank's Enabling the Business of Agriculture Index, Guatemala performs quite well compared to other Feed the Future countries in enabling access to seed, fertilizer, and markets. The country underperforms in enabling access to agricultural machinery, governing transport of agricultural products, and water management. 
 This snapshot was produced by the Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Food Security project, a global support mechanism for Missions and Washington-based USAID offices to address policies as well as legal, institutional, and regulatory factors that affect food security.
