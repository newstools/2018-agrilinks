This brief features selected data on Niger most relevant to USAID/Niger's food security work. According to the World Bank's Enabling the Business of Agriculture Index, Niger underperforms compared to other Feed the Future countries in most categories with the exception of market access and transport regulation. Common across these areas are weaknesses in establishing registration and licensing procedures, such as registration for new seed varieties and fertilizer products as well as machinery imports and water use permits.
 
This snapshot was produced by the Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Food Security project, a global support mechanism for Missions and Washington-based USAID offices to address policies as well as legal, institutional and regulatory factors that affect food security.
