“We need to change policy!” I have heard a variation of this statement hundreds of times over the last five years working as a process facilitator and consultant on development programming across Africa. Just last year, while facilitating a Learning Event on African Agricultural Policy, a clearly exasperated international expert had this ominous warning “we are in midst of a policy reversal, because African countries are increasingly choosing poor policies already failed in the 1970s and 1980s!” Why is it so difficult for researchers, non-state actors and development workers to efficiently influence policy change? To put this question from the perspective of the policymaker: Why do governments often grapple with choosing and maintaining the "right" policies even when it seems so easy to everyone else? Almost everyone has a policy experience of some sort. Here are six lessons I have gleaned over the years. Hopefully, they will help you navigate the well sailed, though largely uncharted, agricultural policy landscape in Africa: What’s your policy process lesson from Africa? Please share thoughts and/or examples in the comments section. I promise to respond and engage.
