The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking applications for a cooperative agreement from qualified U.S. colleges and universities to fund a program entitled Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish. Please view the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NFO) on Grants.gov for complete details. The purpose of this activity is to generate outputs across the fish value chain to improve fish feed and food security; improve fish seed through improved genetics; address nutrition, fish health, emerging diseases and rapid diagnosis, and food safety and processing; and increase knowledge of gender and youth priorities. While one award is anticipated as a result of this NFO, USAID reserves the right to fund any or none of the applications submitted.
