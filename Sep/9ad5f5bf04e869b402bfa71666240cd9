The draft Phase 2 Feed the Future Learning Agenda is currently open for public comment. Please review the overview document and provide your feedback through this survey form. This process will be used to gather your input on the learning questions themselves and also to identify ongoing or planned research or other evidence-generation efforts that may help answer the questions. The Feed the Future community is grateful for your contributions! Through the Feed the Future Learning Agenda, we seek to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Feed the Future initiative, in the short and long term, by generating, synthesizing, and communicating evidence related to key questions. Evidence from the Learning Agenda will inform the design of Feed the Future-related strategies, programs, projects, and activities. We will share the evidence generated from the Learning Agenda with other international development actors such as donors, implementers and beneficiaries to inform their work. The Learning Agenda will also serve to address requirements laid out in the Global Food Security Act (Section 8 (a)14) on sharing lessons learned from implementation of the Feed the Future initiative. The Phase 2 Learning Agenda focuses efforts on the eight areas below. Each is outlined in more detail in the draft overview document.
