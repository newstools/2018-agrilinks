This 3-minute video presents an overview of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Policy (FSP). Taking the example of input subsidy reform in Zambia — a reform that affects millions of farmers and their agrodealers — the video explains how FSP researches policy processes and collaborates with local stakeholders and research institution partners to make evidence-based policy recommendations to local governments. FSP focuses on eight African countries or regions and in Myanmar. The project is funded through USAID.  This video was produced for the Feed the Future Innovation Labs meeting, Washington, DC, September 11, 2018.
