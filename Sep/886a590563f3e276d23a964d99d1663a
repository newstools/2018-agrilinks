What did you discover this summer – a breakthrough in the lab or the classroom? Have a great story from the field to share? If so, Agrilinks.org wants to hear from you! The Agrilinks Young Scholars Food Security Blog Contest is a great opportunity for students around the world to get published and showcase their work to a global community of 14,000+ professionals in food security, agricultural development and beyond. The contest is co-sponsored by the Feed the Future Innovation Labs, which leverage U.S. university research to advance agricultural science and reduce poverty in developing countries, in cooperation with Feed the Future, the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative. What: In an original blog post of 750 words or less, share a personal insight, idea or research finding on global food security and agriculture in the development context. You are encouraged to include photographs, charts/graphs and supporting links within your blog post. Recognition: Winning blog posts will be determined by a panel of USAID/Agrilinks judges. The winning entry and two second place finalists will get top placement in the Agrilinks newsletter and social media, and will be included in communications from Feed the Future on World Food Day. Up to 10 entries will be featured on Agrilinks.org and its affiliated communications channels in October. Who: The contest is open to any university student enrolled in 2018 (graduate or undergraduate, U.S. and abroad). When: Contest entries will be accepted from September 12 – October 10, 2018 (11:59pm EDT). Winners will be announced on World Food Day, October 16. Submit your blog and supporting materials here by October 10 to enter!
