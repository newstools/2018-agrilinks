As global value chains expand and more nations participate in cross-border trade, value-added foods are increasingly beneficial in addressing food security, nutrition and poverty. The term “value-added foods” includes crops or foods that have been enhanced through a variety of improvements, including processing, fortification, increased safety or nutrition, better packaging or extended storage. The benefits of value-added foods include providing better nutrition to children and mothers; greater income for producers; access to new markets; and new processes to improve packaging and storage to reduce waste and ensure greater food safety. This October, Agrilinks explores proven approaches to value addition from around the world. We’d love to hear about your innovative practices, new research and activities that focus on value-added foods. In the meantime, check out some of the best-of pieces that Agrilinks has to share from partners around the world!
