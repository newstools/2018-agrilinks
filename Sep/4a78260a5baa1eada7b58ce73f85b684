The Smallholder Effective Extension Drive Success (SEEDS) project was a USAID, Feed the Future – Partnering for Innovation-funded project designed to address the lack of access to certified, improved seed in northern Mozambique. Managed by NCBA CLUSA, SEEDS aimed to increase yields for six key value chains: sesame, peanut, soya, pigeon pea, cow pea and sugar bean by supporting two local seed companies – Oruwera Seed Company, based in Nampula province, and Phoenix Seeds Limitada, based in Manica province – to create rural seed distribution systems through a network of seed retailers or agrodealers. SEEDS was implemented between January 2015 and April 2017, spanning just over two calendar years and two seed sales campaigns. During this time the project supported both Oruwera and Phoenix to establish networks of agrodealers using NCBA CLUSA’s model of Community Based Service Providers (CBSPs) who are local, community based entrepreneurs who act as one-stop shops in their communities, linking smallholder farmers with suppliers or seeds, inputs, tools, equipment and other necessary products and services. During this time, 281 Oruwera and Phoenix agrodealers or CBSPs were established, trained and sold certified seed in their communities. In addition, to promote the sale and use of certified seed, the SEEDS project partners implemented a range of other initiatives with the aim of increasing the uptake and purchase of certified seed and other inputs, such as seed fairs and promotional events. This white paper serves to outline the principal seed sales activities carried out by SEEDS, review the seed sales statistics over the two campaigns and summarize the main conclusions and lessons learned. It is expected that this document will both add to the existing knowledge base in Mozambique regarding the promotion/sales/distribution of seeds to BOP consumers and improve the effectiveness of future agrodealer and seed sales/distribution related programs aimed at increasing smallholder purchase and uptake of certified seeds, inputs and other technologies.
