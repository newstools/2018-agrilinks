This report highlights key findings from research conducted on the USAID-funded Energy Opportunities for Agricultural Systems and Food Security Project (E4AS Project), which expands and focuses information on how clean energy and energy efficiency can strengthen post-harvest agricultural value chains and reduce loss in targeted countries in Sub Saharan  Africa,  while  also  contributing  to  low emission development strategies. The project also had a strong focus on conducting gender-aware research and highlighting gender-sensitive findings. The research involved a literature review as well as field surveys and case studies conducted in Senegal and Kenya with dairy sector stakeholders during 2018. The report presents findings around these three research questions: 1.  Post harvest clean energy opportunities: What are the key opportunities to increase renewable energy and energy efficient uptake within the farmgate-to-consumer segment? 2.  Integration  into  policy,  partnerships,  and planning:  How can these opportunities be integrated into policy, partnerships, and planning? 3.  Contributions  to  low  emissions  development goals (LEDS):  What  role  can  these  opportunities  for  low carbon energy use in the dairy value chain play in  achieving  a  country’s  LEDS? Check out the accompanying infographic for a quick summary of key findings from this report, with a spotlight on dairy.   Also available, four practical briefs that dive deeper into specific topics:
