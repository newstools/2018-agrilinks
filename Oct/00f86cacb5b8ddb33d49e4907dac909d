In 2018, USAID’s Bureau for Food Security hosted a suite of five webinars designed to increase awareness of Agency tools and strategies for catalyzing finance in the agriculture sector. A well-functioning financial system that supports agricultural market growth is a fundamental building block that undergirds the ability of the private sector to lead development outcomes and contribute to a country’s path to self-reliance. Recognizing the importance of the financial sector, the Global Food Security Strategy places an increased focus on access to finance for all actors in agricultural value chains, from individual households and small-scale producers, to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and even larger firms. Within this ecosystem, agricultural SMEs are critical conduits that can transform agriculture from a survival strategy into a viable, enterprise-led livelihood. However, the vast majority of agricultural SMEs fall into the “missing middle” (roughly defined as financing needs of $25k-$250k), the gap between microfinance and commercial banking that is one of the last frontiers in financial inclusion. Few investors are willing to accept low returns and invest in agricultural SMEs that are riskier, more expensive to monitor, and harder to implement. So, what practical strategies and tools are available to us to encourage greater investment to this challenging sector?
