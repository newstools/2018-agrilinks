Connecting smallholder farmers to markets is a key pathway out of poverty. In this study, the Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Food Security project explores what works well for integrating smallholder farmers into market systems through the private sector and to better understand how the enabling environment impacts business decisions — positively or negatively — as they seek to serve or scale up engagement with smallholder farmers. In addition, the study provides a sounding board for private sector opinions on how USAID and other development partners can best support private sector investment and help to address the policy constraints that threaten to derail these crucial investments.
