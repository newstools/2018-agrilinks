The first post, second post, third post, fourth post, and fifth post in this series are an attempt to convey how Nuru’s approach to rural livelihood development reaches farmers with knowledge, technology and opportunities that they demand and need. It requires intentional co-creation processes from design to impact through to the continuous improvement of program activities using adaptive management techniques. We do this by: These focus areas aim to develop and support a local economy that can remain in balance as new and old shocks disrupt the lives and land of the people dependent on it for their livelihoods. Nuru country offices deliver a co-created service package to farmers that fill their knowledge and resource gaps. The services aim to integrate crops, forests and animals (feed grasses, beans, maize, goat and sheep fattening, and dairy) in a way that is optimal for the human and carrying capacity of the landscape. This is a socio-economic, political, ethnic and ecological landscape that is managed by the farmers and their formal farmer organizations. Nuru’s goal is to ensure that communities have the tools to respond to a variety of rural shocks and maintain their core identity without the need for bad handouts that restrain creativity or debilitate collective action. To achieve and scale this goal to the remote, rural areas marginalized by traditional development initiatives, Nuru welcomes comments, contributions and connections from present and future partners. Thank you and discussion is welcome!
