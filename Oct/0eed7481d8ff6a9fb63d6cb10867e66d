The USAID Bureau for Food Security (BFS), through the Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Food Security project (FTF-EEFS), seeks event planning, communications, and management support for a Resilience and Food Security Summit to take place in the DC Metro Area in June 2019. The Summit will bring together key stakeholders to examine the intersection of self-reliance, enterprise-driven development models, national security, and other important development areas and describe the role of the new Bureau for Resilience and Food Security in leading the integration of these areas to achieve greater development impact. The Summit will also serve as an opportunity for USAID staff and implementing partners to share knowledge and lessons learned around resilience, water security, nutrition, and agriculture-led economic growth. The Summit expects to engage approximately 300-500 people through a three-day event in the DC Metro Area. A budget for the event is still being determined and will be informed by a number of factors including the deliverables generated under this subcontract. The purpose of this Request for Proposals is to identify and subcontract a firm to provide event-planning support, comprised of: Tasks and deliverables completed under the base period of the subcontract will serve as critical inputs for USAID BFS and FTF-EEFS’s event planning process and scoping of follow-on support activities to implement the Summit under a potential option period. FTF-EEFS seeks a firm positioned and interested in conducting both elements (base and option) of the subcontract. Please note the deadline for inquiries/clarifications is October 25, 2018 5:00 p.m. EST, and the proposal deadline is October 30 at 5:00 p.m. EST.
