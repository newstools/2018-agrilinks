Data are vital to sustainably reducing global hunger, malnutrition, and poverty as they support evidence-based investments, accountability, and transparency and enable the measuring of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and other global, regional, and local commitments. Open and accessible data are essential assets that provide a foundation of evidence for scientists and decision-makers globally and help fuel entrepreneurship, innovation, and scientific discovery in food security and nutrition. Feed the Future (FTF) is committed to meeting the open data objectives of the Global Food Security Strategy and USAID’s Public Access Plan.  We have made a  growing number of research datasets publicly accessible since the enactment of USAID’s Open Data Policy in 2014. To date, we have released over seventeen Feed the Future household level survey datasets that you can download from the links below or directly from USAID’s Development Data Library (DDL).  As the first phase of Feed the Future programming closes, more food security datasets will become publicly available through the DDL or through approved external data repositories. These datasets will help maximize investments in follow-on programming, foster evidenced-based policy, and strengthen data-driven agricultural development programs and initiatives. In December 2018, USAID will release a new and improved version of the DDL. Trainings and details will be available soon and announced on this resource page.
