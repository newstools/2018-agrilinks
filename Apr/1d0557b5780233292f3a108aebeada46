The Enabling Business of Agriculture (EBA) Index is a tool that measures data from 63 countries over time on eight areas of agricultural regulations: seeds, fertilizer, machinery, finance, markets, transport, water, and ICT. Two sets of indicators are analyzed: legal indicators and efficiency indicators. Within efficiency indicators, trade indicators measure trade restrictions affecting the export of agricultural products, the import of fertilizers and tractors, and cross-border transport rights. This note unpacks the EBA indicators related to trade — seed, markets, fertilizer, machinery, and transport — as scored against a global scale of 0-100. It offers practitioners the opportunity to calculate country-level trade indicators and to generate country rankings.
