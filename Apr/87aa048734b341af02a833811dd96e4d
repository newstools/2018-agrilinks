 Digital Development for Feed the Future (D2FTF) leverages digital tools holistically and according to best practice to improve the cost effectiveness and development results of the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future Initiative. As part of our mission, we seek to recognize those who are utilizing digital tools to improve farming practices and accelerate the fight against poverty. Help us tell the story of digital agriculture technologies and how they’re working to advance food security and nutrition across the globe by joining our photo contest. Send in your best photos of digital agriculture technologies in action by April 27 for your chance to win prizes of $200, $300 and $500 dollars.
