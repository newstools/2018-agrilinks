USAID is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to invite participants to co-create, co-design, co-invest, and collaborate on innovative research and development (R&D) interventions to address challenges to global food security. Please view the notice on fbo.gov for complete information. Solicitation Number: 7200AA18R00032Title: Feed the Future Global Food Security BAA Deadlines: The intent of the BAA is to create high-quality, effective partnerships to conduct cutting-edge R&D to find new and innovative ways of combating food insecurity and malnutrition. Under this BAA, USAID seeks partners that are committed to shared responsibility, shared risk, and shared resourcing, or co-investment. USAID's Bureau for Food Security (BFS) is seeking R&D to develop new and innovative approaches to enhance agricultural systems and rural development through well-integrated interventions that empower youth and foster improved gender dynamics, particularly in the areas of: 1) Inclusive and sustainable agriculture-led economic growth; 
2) Strengthened resilience among people and systems, especially to new and recurrent shocks and stresses; and 
3) A well-nourished population, especially women and children. Please visit https://feedthefuture.gov/approach for additional information, including target countries and the U.S. Government Global Food Security Strategy.
