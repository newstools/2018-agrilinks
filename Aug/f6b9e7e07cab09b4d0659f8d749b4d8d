This post originally appeared on ICTworks. Do you want to show the power of big data analytics in agriculture? Can you analyze big data to reveal new ways to reduce hunger and poverty? Are you working on digital technologies that push the limits of data-driven science for impact? Apply now for the CGIAR Big Data Inspire Challenge, which has $500,000 in initial grant funding to help you transform agriculture development in four broad focus areas: Winning teams who develop robust responses to climate change, disease, and land degradation challenges will receive $100,000 at the CGIAR Big Data in Agriculture Convention, October 3-5 in Nairobi, Kenya. To encourage long-term adoption and easy access to our data, teams must include a CGIAR center and include a non-CGIAR entity of any type. Teams will have 12 months to implement small-scale proof of concept pilots to demonstrate viability. Successful pilots will be placed on the trajectory to wider-scale implementation, including possibly receiving $250,000 in scale-up funding and additional help in finding widespread adoption within CGIAR. Inspire Challenges are about solving big problems using next-generation ideas. We’re looking for bold, novel ideas that leverage the expansion of big data and digital technologies to unlock new scientific discoveries or enhance the agriculture development enterprise that contain one of these themes:
