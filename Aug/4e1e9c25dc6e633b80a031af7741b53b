Background: Feed the Future Partnering for Innovation is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative.

Through these activities and investments, farmers at all levels of production, including small and medium-sized farmers cultivating up to five hectares of land, will benefit from increased access to high quality seeds and agricultural inputs, mechanization, and other key production services as well as improved business, marketing, and distribution systems.
