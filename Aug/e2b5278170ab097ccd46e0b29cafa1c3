The USAID Center for Resilience commissioned the Overseas Development Institute, in conjunction with the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network (CPAN), to conduct research into resilience and poverty escapes in select Feed the Future focus countries. Specifically, this research examined: why some households escape and remain out of poverty (sustainable poverty escape), while other households escape it only to fall back into poverty (transitory poverty escape) and still others descend into poverty for the first time (impoverishment). Building on research conducted through the Leveraging Economic Opportunity activity in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Uganda in 2016, the current body of research was aimed at expanding understanding of the drivers of sustained and transitory poverty escapes and teasing out policy and programming implications for USAID and other development actors. The second in the series of resulting research reports focuses on rural Kenya, where transitory poverty escapes are a significant phenomenon. The report combines analysis from four rounds of 2000-2010 Tegemeo Agricultural Panel Survey with qualitative research approaches in two rural counties to investigate the drivers of transitory poverty escapes and reimpoverishment, as well as the resources, attributes, and activities of households that enable them to escape poverty sustainably. Key findings from the report include: Household resource base Household attributes and capacities Household activities Household shocks Household strategies for sustained poverty escapes See the sidebar for the full report and its companion policy implication brief.
