Fall Armyworm (FAW) is an invasive and damaging pest endemic to the Americas that is spreading across Africa, particularly targeting maize, a vital staple crop. FAW will have long-term effects on crop yields, food supplies, livelihoods, trade, and threaten the resilience of chronically vulnerable populations. The  impact of FAW highlights a fundamental challenge smallholder farmers face—limited access to information, tools, technologies and management practices—and the need for systems that effectively respond to emerging transboundary threats. Feed the Future strengthens the capacity of African communities, institutions and governments to manage FAW through a range of sustainable and effective Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies that protect people and the environment. Feed the Future, in conjunction with a USAID Bureau for Food Security-led Task Force, is working to disseminate the latest research and evidence-based technologies and management practices through resources and tools such as: Contact fallarmyworm@usaid.gov (link sends e-mail) for more information.
