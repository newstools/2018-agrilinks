Background: Feed the Future Partnering for Innovation is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative. The goal of this announcement is to develop public private partnerships to support smallholder farmers and complement the U.S Government Global Food Security Strategy by directly engaging with the private sector in Latin America and the Caribbean. Partnering for Innovation, with the USAID Bureau of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), will partner and co-fund new investments with the private sector to address development and business challenges in selected LAC countries. Through these activities and investments, smallholder farmers will benefit from new and/or expanded market opportunities, increased access to improved agricultural inputs and mechanization, and better quality technical advisory services. Smallholders are defined as farmers who cultivate less than five hectares of land. All awards issued under Partnering for Innovation will be performance-based with partners achieving performance milestones over the period of the award. Funding Opportunity: Overall funding from Partnering for Innovation for this solicitation is up to $700,000 with up to two partnerships anticipated.
