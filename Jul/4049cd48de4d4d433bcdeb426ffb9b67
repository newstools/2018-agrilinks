The success of women in agribusiness is not only determined by the level of access to resources and business assets, but also by gender-specific behavior and roles, which influence women’s decision-making power and control around these resources and business assets. Tackling the inequalities that exist between men and women in many rural agricultural societies therefore also requires a change in the deeply entrenched gender norms that are at the root of these inequalities. As an entry point to reflect on and transform restrictive gender norms and power relations, the EOWE program of SNV Netherlands Development Organisation organizes facilitated household dialogues among targeted family and/or community members in Kenya and Vietnam to critically reflect and discuss the key norms that prevent women from fully participating in and benefiting from economic activities. The EOWE program just launched a new series of three publications on the experiences and initial impact of the first round of gender-transformative household dialogues that were conducted in 2017. The publications document the stories of men and women from Kenya and Vietnam on their process of rethinking gender norms that limit women’s economic empowerment and gender equality in agricultural value chains and present the program’s key findings on the patterns of change.
