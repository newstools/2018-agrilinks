The Feed the Future Developing Local Extension Capacity project (DLEC) conducts diagnostics in Feed the Future target countries to evaluate the extension ecosystem and provide insight into the strengths and challenges faced by national extension systems. The diagnostics use the "best-fit" framework to examine extension from a systems perspective, looking at six extension characteristics: governance structures and policy environment; organizational and management capacities and cultures; advisory methods; market engagement; livelihood strategies; and community engagement. The latest DLEC report is on Mali’s extension system (other countries with DLEC reports include Bangladesh, Guinea, Honduras, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda and Senegal). The report uses a combination of literature review, site visits and interviews with key informants to gain insight on the extension system in Mali. It also provides an assessment of the Feed the Future Livestock for Growth (L4G) project's extension activities and makes recommendations for strengthening the project. Each report lists key entry points or drivers of success that already exist in-country for improving the extension system. In Mali, this includes: Recommendations to improve extension in Mali include: For much more information, including additional recommendations, please see the report.
