The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems invites applications for new funds that will be used to complement existing research projects of the Livestock Systems Innovation Lab. Previous, broader funding opportunities from the Livestock Systems Innovation Lab have supported more than 20 research projects in Burkina Faso, Niger, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Nepal and Cambodia. Building on established research and partnerships, this opportunity seeks to address gaps in research on country-specific priorities defined during the first mutlitstakeholder Innovation Platform meetings in the respective countries. The duration of projects is restricted to 18 months, and they must clearly add value to existing projects in the target countries. This Request for Applications is for two types of projects: This Request for Applications is available online. The deadline to submit proposals is August 31, 2018. Funding for these projects is not guaranteed, and it is contingent on allocation of more funding to the Livestock Systems Innovation Lab by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems conducts research targeting small-scale livestock-keepers in developing countries. It generates scientific evidence to improve livestock production and marketing, conservation and consumption of animal-source foods. Managed by the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences and its partner, the International Livestock Research Institute, its vision is to sustainably intensify smallholder livestock systems in order to improve human nutrition, health, livelihoods and incomes.
