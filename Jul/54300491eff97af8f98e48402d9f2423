I hope you enjoyed reading about Feed the Future’s food policy processes during policy month in June. In addition to the many recent posts, check out a few more relevant events and posts from Agrilinks below: A recent Agriculture Commercial, Legal, Institutional and Regulatory (AgCLIR) Assessment in Ghana (summary and full report) provides actionable recommendations for strategic and impactful enabling environment reform across agricultural market systems. In addition, you might want to check out the Agribusiness Regulation and Institutions (AGRI) Index Pilot and Final reports which showcase early benchmarking efforts for agribusinesses funded by USAID. These ultimately informed the development of the Enabling the Business of Agriculture Index. Other analyses of interest are cross-border trade studies — like the Rwanda Cross-Border Ag Trade Analysis, which uncovers unfilled demand in cross-border markets and outlines trade opportunities for actors along select agricultural value chains — and the cross border study in the Lower Mekong region of Asia that focuses on the enabling environment for trade of agriculture inputs. Stay tuned! There is more to come this month!
